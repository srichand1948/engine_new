  # You can override concurrency based on environment. It is common practice
  # to let concurrency be dictated by RAILS_MAX_THREADS, see details here:
  # https://gist.github.com/nateberkopec/2d1fcf77dc61e747438252e3895badf0
  #
  # That said, you may not want your worker concurrency and web thread
  # count tied together, so you can optionally set a WORKER_CONCURRENCY
  # value:
  :concurrency: <%= ENV['WORKER_CONCURRENCY'] || ENV['RAILS_MAX_THREADS'] || 5 %>
